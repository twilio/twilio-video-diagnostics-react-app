# 1.0.0 (September 1, 2021)

This is the beta release of the Twilio Video Diagnostics App. This application demonstrates a diagnostics tool for testing a participant's ability to have a quality video call with the Twilio platform. It can be used as part of onboarding to ensure a successful first video call or for diagnosing issues that relate to the device, software, or network conditions of the end-user. It is built with [Twilio's Programmable Video JS SDK](https://sdk.twilio.com/js/video/releases/2.16.0/docs/) and [Twilio's RTC Diagnostics SDK](https://twilio.github.io/rtc-diagnostics/globals.html).

This release includes the following features:

- Stepwise tests to diagnose issues due to the local environment of a video participant.
- Provides a recommended course of action when tests fail.
- Easy to download JSON formatted test report for simplified sharing and integration into support workflows.

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community so that we can continue to iterate on this initial set of features in order to provide the best experience.
